# â˜• Cozy Tea

**Cozy Tea** is a mood-based tea recommendation web app. Users type how they feel, and the app responds with a tea suggestion that matches their mood. The goal is to create a calming, cozy experience using simple design and AI-generated responses.

This is the first version of the project, currently focused on user input and AI-powered output. Upcoming features include detailed tea cards with ingredients, benefits, and visuals.
